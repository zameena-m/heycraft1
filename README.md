# Old York City: The resurgence of neighborhoods around NYC

# Audience
Resurgence is a publication geared to New Yorkers seeking to learn more about "up and coming" and already "hip" neighborhoods and the histories of those neighborhoods. A ride on public transportation from borough to borough can take as long as a drive to another state, so what makes certain neighborhoods unique? Old York City introduces NYC to travelers passing through and to young adults learning their way around the borough. It also reintroudces long-time residents to places they once might have deemed unsuitable for the booming culture these places now host.

# Is there a similar publication? If yes, how will your publication differentiate itself from the existing publication?
DNAinfo and Gothamist might be rival publications but Old York City provides a space for feature-style stories that might build upon the hard news coming out of these other publications.

<strong>Health and Science:</strong>  Antivaxxers are probably concentrated in one of these "hip" neighborhoods, if they're not then where are they? Affluent neighborhoods? Is there a correlation between this new wave of thinking and how close these thinkers live to each other?
